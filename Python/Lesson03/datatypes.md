# Data Types in Python

In Python, data types are classifications that specify the kind of data a variable can hold. Understanding data types is fundamental for effective programming because they dictate what operations can be performed on a given piece of data and how it will be stored and accessed in memory.

## Primary Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types, each serving specific purposes. Below are the main types:

### 1. Numeric Types

Python has three primary numeric types:

- **Integer (int):** Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative. Example: `42`, `-5`.
- **Float (float):** Represents numbers with decimal points. Example: `3.14`, `-0.5`.
- **Complex (complex):** Represents complex numbers with a real and imaginary part. Example: `3+5j`.

Python handles integers with arbitrary precision, meaning they can grow as large as the available memory allows.

### 2. String (str)

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data. Strings are enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`).

Example:
```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
```

Python strings are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be modified.

### 3. Boolean (bool)

Booleans represent logical values: `True` or `False`. They are commonly used in conditional statements and expressions.

Example:
```python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False
```

### 4. None Type

The `None` type is a special data type representing the absence of a value or a null value in Python. It is often used as a default return type for functions without a specified return statement.

Example:
```python
result = None
```

## Collection Data Types

Python offers several collection data types for storing multiple values within a single variable.

### 5. List

Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can hold elements of any data type. Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ... ]`.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### 6. Tuple

Tuples are ordered collections similar to lists, but they are immutable. Tuples are defined using parentheses `( ... )`.

Example:
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

### 7. Set

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate values and are defined using curly braces `{ ... }`.

Example:
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### 8. Dictionary (dict)

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{ ... }` with a colon separating keys and values.

Example:
```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}
```

## Additional Data Types

### 9. Range

The `range` type represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops for iteration.

Example:
```python
for i in range(5):  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    print(i)
```

### 10. Bytes and Bytearray

- **Bytes:** Represents immutable sequences of bytes, commonly used in binary data.
- **Bytearray:** Similar to bytes but is mutable.

Example:
```python
byte_data = b"Hello"
byte_array_data = bytearray(b"World")
```

### 11. Frozen Set

A `frozenset` is an immutable version of a set, meaning its elements cannot be changed once assigned.

Example:
```python
fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

| `float`      | Floating point numbers               | `3.14`, `-0.5`                 |
| `complex`    | Complex numbers                      | `3 + 5j`                       |
| `str`        | String (text)                        | `"Hello"`, `'Python'`          |
| `bool`       | Boolean (True or False)              | `True`, `False`                |
| `None`       | Represents no value or null          | `None`                         |
| `list`       | Ordered, mutable collection          | `[1, 2, 3]`                    |
| `tuple`      | Ordered, immutable collection        | `(1, 2, 3)`                    |
| `set`        | Unordered collection of unique items | `{1, 2, 3}`                    |
| `dict`       | Unordered collection of key-value    | `{"key": "value"}`             |
| `range`      | Sequence of numbers for iteration    | `range(0, 5)`                  |
| `bytes`      | Immutable byte sequences             | `b"data"`                      |
| `bytearray`  | Mutable byte sequences               | `bytearray(b"data")`           |
| `frozenset`  | Immutable version of a set           | `frozenset({1, 2, 3})`         |
